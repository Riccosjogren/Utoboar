    <h2>The basic idea for this project is: We wanted to make a customizable bear head that can be created using inputs. Certain questions will be asked to put the head together. This Bear comes alive and eventually, other questions will be asked to determine how the bear feels in response to your answer, and it will also show emotions.

    <h2>I made a snake game based off the google snake game but this one uses golden apples that are worth more points. I used a leaderboard to keep score on the game and all of the actions. Music also plays when the game is started and the you can continue to feed your snake.</h2>

	<h2>We made a platformer game on scratch where our Bird is lost and you have to help it get home while avoiding obstacles and eating worms on the way.</h2>

      <img src="Images/Rivermeanders.JPG" height="500">
	    <h2>We explored a river simulation represents how a river can move through erosion. In the simulation the sediment around where the water flows slowly breaks down to small pieces and is moved by the river causing a constant change in the shape of the river. After research of this simulation we evaluated randomness, simplification, and biases in the model. We also thought about what changes could be made to the model in order to make it more realistic and apply it to the real world as well as asked questions of what other factors could effect the model.</h2>

    <h1>   3.1.6 Rover Phone Home.</h1>
       <img src="Images/Roverchart.PNG" height="300">
      <h2>We looked at simulated data from a rover with model environments and we had to find out what environment in which the rover was located. We also had to use spreadsheet functons to help dsetermine the unsorted data that was given to us. Due to the data collected, we have concluded that the rover is in the desert plains. We saw that the temperature was rising quickly during the day time which made us think it was in the rocky mountains however the sound data wasnâ€™t as low as the sounds in the mountains are expected to be so because of the sound we chose the Desert plains.
